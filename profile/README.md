# Welcome to PlazaNet!
[**PlazaNet's Website**](https://plazanet.org)

PlazaNet is a friendly, creative social network built on the belief that online communities should feel personal and expressive — just like the classic Nintendo Miiverse, reimagined for today!

It’s completely self-hostable, open source, and designed to make connecting with others fun again.
