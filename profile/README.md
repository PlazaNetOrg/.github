# Welcome to PlazaNet!

[**PlazaNet.org**](https://plazanet.org)  
PlazaNet is a friendly, creative social network inspired by the spirit of classic Nintendo Miiverse — reimagined for today.  

It’s fully **self-hostable**, **open source**, and built to make online communities feel personal, expressive, and fun again. Share drawings, connect with friends, join themed hubs (communities), and more — all while keeping things light and nostalgic.

## Core Components

### Servers

- **[Accounts](https://github.com/PlazaNetOrg/Accounts)**  
  Central authentication server for PlazaNet and GamePlaza.  
  Handles login, user profiles, friends lists, and other information.  
  ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
  ![Gin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gin-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gin&logoColor=white)
  ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
  ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
  ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

- **[PlazaNet](https://github.com/PlazaNetOrg/PlazaNet)** _(Development starting soon)_  
  The heart of the social network — posts, communities, followers, reactions, and PlazaNet-specific features.  
  Requires the Accounts server for authentication.  
  ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
  ![Gin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gin-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gin&logoColor=white)
  ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
  ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
  ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)

> **Note:** The Accounts server provides unified authentication and friends features for both PlazaNet and GamePlaza.  
> This design makes it easy for users who only want the GamePlaza launcher (with its social features like seeing friends online) to run just the Accounts server — without needing to host the full PlazaNet social backend.
